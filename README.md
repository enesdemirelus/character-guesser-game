This is a game written by me in Python that allows you to play a game to guess the character from desired fictional world or real life. The game starts for asking where to get characters, and OpenAI API creates 25 most known characters from desired fictional world or real life characters and then code randomly selects one. You can use ChatGPT to ask yes/no questions, get hints from the dictionary ChatGPT wrote, or guess the character. I wrote this code to understand how does API's work, especially OpenAI API. The code uses ChatGPT4.
